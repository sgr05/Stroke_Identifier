# Problem statement
Stroke is a critical health concern worldwide, often leading to severe outcomes if not identified and addressed promptly. This dataset provides comprehensive patient information, including demographic, medical, and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, glucose levels, BMI, smoking status. The goal of this analysis is to utilize the dataset to identify key indicators and develop a robust predictive model for stroke risk. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, this study aims to enhance early detection, enabling targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare burdens
# MODEL SELECTION
Developed a predictive model using Random Forest and  assess stroke risk, achieving 93% accuracy by analyzing patient demographics and medical history.Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning on a healthcare dataset to optimize model performance and derive actionable insights.
